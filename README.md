Sales Synergy: Predicting Walmart Weekly Sales
This project tackles Walmart's inventory optimization challenge by forecasting weekly sales across its retail locations using machine learning. Leveraging the publicly available Walmart dataset from Kaggle, the analysis integrates economic indicators, weather data, and lagged sales features to enhance predictive accuracy.

🔍 Key Features:

Cleaned and transformed historical sales data (2010–2012)

Engineered time-based and lagged sales features

Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Built a high-performance XGBoost model (R² = 0.93) for weekly sales prediction

Identified seasonality, holiday effects, and regional sales variability

📈 Tools & Tech:

Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

💡 Future Applications:

Real-time retail sales forecasting

Inventory planning and logistics optimization

Extensions to other KPIs (staffing, returns, customer traffic)

⚖️ Ethical Considerations:
Care is taken to mitigate bias and ensure model transparency. Human oversight is emphasized to supplement machine-generated insights.
